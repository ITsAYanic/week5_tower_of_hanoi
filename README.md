## description
I want do develop a small tower of hanoi game with Godot.
For that I'll need to finish the tutorial and write a python script that can solfe this with higher order funtions. The Higher order function needs to be done before thursday.
The game should have a simple ui, you can dd more disks and autosolfe it (autosolving meaning that a algorithm calculates what needs to be done and then solves it with a animation)
The piece colour should be a gradiend from bright to dark.

## To Do
- [ ] find out how to solve the hanoi tower problem
- [ ] find out what higher order functions are because our teacher can't teach 
- [ ] Write a algorithm with higher order functions to solve it with python
- [ ] finish the Godot turorial
- [ ] build a tower of hanoi game
- [ ] implement a auto solving function with higher order functions
